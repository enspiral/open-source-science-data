        <p>
                        It is commonly assumed that growth and aging are somehow linked, but the
                        nature of this link has been elusive.   Here we review the aging process as
                        a continuation of TOR-driven growth. TOR is absolutely essential for
                        developmental growth, but upon completion of development it causes aging
                        and age-related diseases.  Thus, the nutrient-sensing and growth-promoting
                        TOR signaling pathway may provide a molecular link between growth and aging
                        that is universal from yeast to human.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>
                    At first glance, growth and aging appear
                        to be opposites.  Growth is energy-driven synthesis of macromolecules from
                        simple nutrients, an increase of order and a decrease of entropy.  Aging is
                        decay, a loss of order and a rise of entropy.  Seemingly, growth and aging are
                        mutually exclusive.  Forever proliferating cells, such as legendary hydras, do
                        not show signs of aging.  In contrast, when an organism ceases to grow, aging
                        follows.  However, manipulations that decrease growth also decrease aging and
                        prolong life span.  For example, calorie restriction (reduced nutrient intake)
                        reduces growth and increases longevity in diverse species from yeast to mice. 
                        Rapamycin, which inhibits growth in yeast, decelerates yeast aging.  Inactivation
                        of the growth-promoting insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway increases life span,
                        from worms to mice.  Why do growth-inhibiting conditions slow down aging?  Are
                        growth and aging mechanistically similar?  As
                        we discuss here, growth and aging may not be opposites but rather a
                        continuation of one another driven by the same molecular pathway.  Aging and
                        growth may be linked in a way that growth produces aging.  In
                        other words, excessive growth is a driving force for aging.  The molecular
                        pathway that drives both growth and aging appears to be the evolutionarily
                        conserved TOR (target of rapamycin) pathway.

        <title>The TOR pathway
                        </title>
        <p>TOR (Target Of Rapamycin), as its name indicates, was
                            originally discovered, in yeast, as the target of the antifungal drug rapamycin. 
                            Rapamycin is a natural secondary metabolite produced by soil bacteria to
                            inhibit growth of fungal competitors.  Thus, it is a mirror image of penicillin
                            that is produced by fungi to inhibit bacterial growth.  Remarkably, TOR is
                            structurally and functionally conserved from yeast to human (including worms,
                            flies, plants and mice) as an essential, central controller of cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>].
                            TOR in mammals (mTOR) controls cell growth and metabolism in response to
                            nutrients (e.g., amino acids), growth factors (e.g., insulin, IGF-1, PDGF), and
                            cellular energy status (ATP).  Nutrients are the dominant TOR input as high
                            levels of amino acids can compensate for an absence of the other mTOR inputs
                            but not vice versa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], and only nutrients activate TOR in unicellular
                            organisms.  The growth factor signaling pathway, grafted onto the more
                            ancestral nutrient sensitive TOR pathway, co-evolved with multicellularity. 
                            TOR activates cell growth by positively and negatively regulating several
                            anabolic and catabolic processes, respectively, that collectively determine mass
                            accumulation.  The anabolic processes include transcription, protein
                            synthesis, ribosome biogenesis, nutrient transport, and mitochondrial
                            metabolism.  Conversely, TOR negatively regulates catabolic processes such as
                            mRNA degradation, ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, and autophagy.  TOR is an
                            atypical serine/threonine kinase that is found in two functionally and
                            structurally distinct multiprotein complexes, TORC1 and TORC2 (mTORC1 and
                            mTORC2 in mammals), each of which signals via a different set of effector
                            pathways.   TORC1 is rapamycin sensitive whereas TORC2 is rapamycin
                            insensitive.  The best-characterized phosphorylation substrates of mTOR are S6K
                            and 4E-BP1 via which mTORC1 controls translation, and Akt/PKB via which mTORC2
                            controls cell survival and other processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>].  Like TOR itself, the two TOR
                            complexes and the overall architecture of the TOR signaling network appear to
                            be conserved from yeast to human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>].  TOR and many of the processes it
                            controls have also been shown to play a role in aging (in addition to growth)
                            in a wide variety of organisms, as described below.

        <title>Aging in budding yeast
                        </title>
        <p>Budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is a particularly
                            useful model system to study aging because it can be used to study both
                            replicative aging and chronological aging.  Replicative aging is measured by
                            the number of daughter cells (divisions) a mother cell can produce. 
                            Chronological aging, also referred to as postmitotic aging, is measured by the
                            length of time a non-dividing cell can survive.  Inhibition of TORC1 signaling
                            in yeast extends both replicative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>] and chronological [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>] life span. Thus,
                            TOR appears to promote aging regardless of physiological context (mitotic or
                            post-mitotic cells).
                        
                </p>
        <p>In yeast, the link between growth and
                            aging has been known sinse the 1950's is particularly spectacular. Yeast cells
                            grow larger as they grow older [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]<bold>. </bold>The yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>
                            typically divides asymmetrically to give a large mother cell and a smaller
                            daughter cell. As mother cells become old, they enlarge and produce daughter
                            cells that are larger than daughters derived from young mother cells. Like
                            large mothers, large daughter cells have shorter replicative life span [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].
                        
                </p>
        <p>The use of unicellular yeast to study aging is
                            revealing also because here the cell is the organism.  Therefore, it is a model
                            for cell aging and organismal longevity.  As we discuss below, TOR also
                            controls longevity in multicellular organisms.

        <title>TOR and aging from worm to mammals 
                        </title>
        <p>Inhibition of TOR signaling enhances life span in
                            worms, flies and possibly mammals.  The nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> contains a
                            constant number of post-mitotic cells and lives about twenty days. The
                            first demonstration that TOR controls life span was by Vellai et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] who
                            showed that knocking down TOR in  <italic>-C. elegans</italic> more than doubles this
                            worm's normal life span. They examined specifically the role of TOR in aging
                            based on the prior knowledge that both TOR and life span are regulated by
                            nutrients and insulin.  Indeed, a large body of earlier, groundbreaking work
                            showing that calorie restriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] or down regulation of insulin/IGF-1
                            signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] extends life span is consistent with the observation that
                            down regulation of TOR also extends life span.  Interestingly, inhibition of
                            TOR starting either during development or on the first day of adulthood gives
                            comparable life span extension, suggesting that TOR controls longevity mainly,
                            if not exclusively, during adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>].  Jia et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>] subsequently
                            demonstrated that worms deficient in raptor, a TORC1-specific subunit, also
                            have an extended life span, indicating that TOR promotes aging via at least
                            TORC1, if not via both TORCs.
                        
                </p>
        <p> In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, TOR is required for growth
                            during larval development, and for increases in cellular growth caused by
                            growth factor signaling and nutrient availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Genetic inhibition of
                            the <italic>Drosophila</italic> TOR pathway, either upstream or downstream of TOR,
                            extends life span [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].  Furthermore, reducing the function of <italic>Drosophila</italic>
                            TOR results in decreased lipid stores and glucose levels, and prevents
                            metabolic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>].  The life span extension is observed upon down
                            regulation of TOR signaling in the fat body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], underscoring the importance
                            of fat in aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Downregulating TOR signaling in the fat body not
                            only extends the life of the fly, it also reduces the size of the entire
                            organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], providing yet another link between growth and aging. The
                            apparently central role of TOR signaling in the fly fat body in regulating life
                            span may be recapitulated by mammalian TOR in adipose tissue.  In mice,
                            decreased insulin/IGF-1 signaling in adipose tissue, and consequently less
                            active downstream mTOR signaling, increases life span [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Furthermore,
                            adult-onset growth hormone or IGF-1 deficiency increases life span in rodents
                            [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>].  Also, mice deficient for mTORC1 or the mTORC1 effector S6K are protected

                            tested for its ability to extend lifespan in mice in the National Interventions

        <p>Finally, calorie restriction, in which nutrient intake
                            is restricted to 60-70% that of voluntary levels, increases life span in most
                            species including mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Although anti-aging mechanisms of CR are
                            still disputed, one of the mechanisms is likely inactivation of the TOR
                            pathway. Indeed, taking into account that i) inhibition of TOR extends life
                            span and ii) nutrients activate TOR, the mechanism of how restriction of
                            nutrients can increase life span seems apparent.

        <title>Downstream of TOR</title>
        <p>
                        How does TOR promote aging in response to nutrients? 
                            In other words, which of the many TORC1-controlled processes that are either up
                            regulated or down regulated upon nutrient deprivation (TORC1 inactivation)
                            leads to longer life?  Recent evidence suggests that TORC1 controls aging via
                            several of its downstream processes, including autophagy, ribosome biogenesis
                            and protein synthesis, transcription, and mitochondrial activity.  Indeed,
                            there is a remarkable correlation between TOR-controlled processes and
                            processes in aging.  It is also important to note that these processes
                            constitute the normal program via which TOR controls cell growth, suggesting
                            that TOR control of aging is an extension or continuation of its control of
                            growth.
                        
                </p>
        <p>TORC1 inhibits autophagy, a process of bulk
                            degradation of proteins and organelles by lysosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>].  Autophagy is
                            inhibited in aging and age-related diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Restoration of autophagy
                            depletes mitochondria with deleterious mtDNA mutations but spares their normal
                            counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Furthermore,  autophagy is essential for life span extension
                            at least in worms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. This suggests that TORC1 promotes aging in part via
                            inhibition of autophagy.
                        
                </p>
        <p> TORC1 activates ribosome biogenesis and protein
                            synthesis. Recent studies show that inhibition of ribosome biogenesis and
                            global protein synthesis extends life span [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>].  Reducing the levels of
                            ribosomal proteins and translation initiation factors extends life span in both
                            yeast and worms.  Thus, this is consistent with the notion that TORC1 may
                            promote aging via activation of ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis.
                        
                </p>
        <p>TORC1 in yeast negatively regulates the
                            stress-activated transcription factors GIS1 and MSN2/4.  Both transcription
                            factors are required for life span extension upon down regulation of TOR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. A longevity-related gene up regulated by MSN2/4 upon TOR inhibition is the
                            nicotinamidase gene <italic>PCN1</italic>.  Interestingly, nicotinamidase converts
                            nicotinamide to NAD<sup>+</sup> which in turn activates SIR2, suggesting that
                            TOR and sirtuins are part of the same longevity pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>].  Furthermore, as
                            discussed below, TOR negatively regulates mitochondrial gene expression to
                            limit life span [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>].
                        
                </p>
        <p>TORC1 controls mitochondrial activity, but in
                            different ways depending on the organism.  In yeast, TORC1 inhibits
                            mitochondrial respiration whereas in mammals (at least in muscle) it stimulates
                            respiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>].  This divergence in regulation is probably related to the
                            fact that glucose, a nutrient sensed by TORC1, triggers anaerobic fermentation
                            in yeast.  A similar glucose-dependent shift in respiration does not occur in
                            mammals.  Consistent with the above, increased mitochondrial respiration
                            extends life span in yeast whereas in mammalian cells life span extension
                            correlates with reduced respiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>].  However, the role of
                            mitochondria in life span extension remains elusive, particularly with the
                            recent demonstration that TORC1 in mammalian adipose tissue, like in yeast,
                            negatively controls respiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>].

        <p>As we discuss below, overactive TOR seems to be

                            TOR mediated cell hypertrophy to organismal aging. In contrast, a replicative
                            limit has never been shown to be important <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. It is a
                            hyperthropic, secretory phenotype of aging cells that can be linked to organismal
                            aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>].

        <p>If growth and aging are mechanistically linked, are
                            older cells larger?  In yeast, old cells are large and cell size predicts
                            replicative life span [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]. This also appears to be the case for senescent
                            mammalian cells.  An increase in cell size is a hallmark of senescent
                            fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. Their cell volume is several fold greater compared with
                            proliferating cells. Cell size is progressively increased in cell culture as
                            cells progress toward senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]. Furthermore, it was suggested 20
                            years ago that cell size is a marker of cell senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>]. Ironically,
                            TOR had not been discovered at that time and the significance of this
                            phenomenological observation was unclear. The notion that TOR is involved in
                            both growth and aging now provides a mechanistic explanation for an old
                            observation.
                        
                </p>
        <p>Cell growth is an increase in cell volume, or mass,
                            due to metabolic activity including synthesis of macromolecules (RNA, protein,
                            lipid) and organelles.  If a cell grows without division, it becomes hypertrophic. 
                            In other words, when the cell cycle is blocked in the presence of
                            growth-promoting signaling, then cells increase in size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>].
                        
                </p>
        <p>Thus, cell growth is counterbalanced by cell division
                            such that cells maintain a characteristic size.  The simplest way to cause both
                            cell hypertrophy and cell senescence is to prevent cell division without
                            inhibiting cell growth. Inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin decreases the
                            hypertrophic cell phenotype caused by induction of the CDK inhibitor p21
                            [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>].
                        
                </p>
        <p>All these observations suggest that mTOR signaling
                            plays a role in aging of single cells.  How is this related to aging of
                            multicellular organisms?  As discussed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>], TOR-driven alterations
                            can be linked to metazoan aging and, in particular, diseases of aging such as
                            cancer, metabolic syndrome, atherosclerosis, hypertension and hypertrophic
                            heart.

        <p>Rapamycin is given to renal transplant patients
                            everyday for several years to prevent organ rejection.  We view this as an
                            unintentional clinical trial of a potentially anti-aging drug. First, in such
                            patients, rapamycin unexpectedly turned out to prevent cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>] and even
                            cured some types of pre-existing tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>]. Second, 2 years after
                            transplantation, body-mass index was significantly lower in the rapamycin-based
                            treatment arm compared to cyclosporine, indicating that rapamycin prevents obesity
                            [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>].

        <p>Rapamycin is safe enough to be used in

                            volunteers, a single dose was not associated with side effects. In 11 healthy
                            men (29 years old, BMI 23 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), 6 mg of rapamycin decreased
                            S6K phosphorylation, preventing insulin resistance caused by nutrients. Thus,
                            the activity state of the mTOR pathway can modulate insulin sensitivity in

        <title>Why TOR? </title>
        <p>Cell growth and division are the two most fundamental
                            features of life. Using simple compounds and energy, living organisms build
                            macromolecules according to their own plan, transforming non-self to self.  Not
                            surprisingly, the growth-controlling TOR signaling pathway is conserved from
                            yeast to human.  In unicellular organisms, it maximizes growth as long as
                            nutrients are available.  However, life-promoting TOR signaling seems also to
                            contain seeds of death.  Aging and its manifestations such as age-related
                            diseases appear with excessive growth-promoting signaling, when actual growth
                            is not longer possible. Aging is not programmed, of course, but is an aimless
                            continuation of the same process that drives developmental growth. Since aging
                            does not limit life span in the wild, switch-off of this ‘growth program'
                            cannot evolve.  Growth should be robust and not be slowed down to avoid aging.
                            Furthermore, the aging-growth program cannot be switched off by an accidental
                            mutation, because such a mutation would be lethal or at least reduce fitness
                            during development.  Yet, TOR can be inhibited pharmacologically.
